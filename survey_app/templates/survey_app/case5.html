                <p>With more than 54,000 students across 67 schools, Cherry Creek School District (CCSD) in Colorado faced significant challenges in addressing the growing mental health needs of its diverse student population. In response, the district developed an innovative, technology-enhanced mental health framework that has become a model for large districts nationwide.</p>

                <p>In 2020, Cherry Creek launched its Integrated Mental Health Framework (IMHF), a comprehensive system designed to address the full spectrum of student mental health needs. The framework combines evidence-based practices with innovative technology solutions to create a coordinated approach across three tiers of support.</p>
