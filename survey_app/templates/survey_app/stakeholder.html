                As you start using digital mental health tools, it is important to engage key community members including school counselors and community mental health providers. Stakeholders play a pivotal role in assessing student need, selecting products, identifying funding, and putting these tools in place.

        <h1><strong>Foundations Of Stakeholder Engagement</strong></h1>
            <h2>Stage 1: Stakeholders to include</h2>
                <p>Identifying stakeholders to engage in the process begins with understanding who they are and the roles each of them can play in implementing digital mental health and well-being products. Districts should engage stakeholder groups that will be involved in implementing your chosen product. For example, if teachers implement the product with students in the classroom, teacher voices should be heard through the planning and implementation process</p>
                <h3 class="dropdown-toggle">There are many stakeholder groups within school communities, and each offers unique perspectives and expertise, including: </h3>
                <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                    <li>Students</li>
                    <li>Caregivers</li>
                    <li>Teachers</li>
                    <li>Technology Departments</li>
                    <li>Campus administrators</li>
                    <li>District administrators</li>
                    <li>Finance administrators</li>
                    <li>School counselors</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Stage 2: Best Practices for Building and Maintaining Relationships</h2>
                <p>Building trusting relationships with and among stakeholder groups is an essential foundation for successful stakeholder engagement. It helps them work together to meet student mental health needs and provides opportunities to educate and unify your community.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bring stakeholders in from the very beginning</strong><p>This demonstrates that their input is valued and allows you to fully benefit from their expertise, resources, and experiences. It shows transparency and collaborative decision-making and invites a community discussion about evidence-based practices to address the mental health needs of students and staff.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Establish clear expectations on how you will use stakeholders’ feedback to inform the decision-making process.</strong><p>Stakeholders should understand how you plan to take differing perspectives into account. They should also understand that while they will guide decision-making, school boards and district staff will make the final decisions that consider local decision-making policies from state law, board policy, and financial procurement rules.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Be prepared to handle different perspectives and disagreements.</strong><p>Listen fully to each point of view, looking for areas of agreement and alignment between perspectives. Keep each group’s perspective in mind as you move through the needs assessment, product selection, funding, and implementation phases, weighing the pros and cons of each perspective for a final decision that reflects shared community values and can effectively meet student needs.</p></li>
                </ul>

        <h1><strong>Planning for Stakeholder Engagement at Each Stage</strong></h1>
            <p>Stakeholder engagement is a continuous process, and you should plan for it throughout the journey of selecting and implementing digital products to support student mental health and well-being. The remainder of this section highlights every stage of stakeholder engagement: assessing student needs, selecting a product, funding, and implementation. While many stakeholders have a role throughout the process, we call out the key stakeholders in each stage.</p>

            <h2>Stage 1: Engaging Stakeholders to Assess Student Needs</h2>
                <p>It is critical to assess students’ needs for mental health support from the beginning. In this phase, you will bring together a variety of perspectives and expertise to understand the challenges students are experiencing around mental health and well-being, as well as gauge where student well-being and mental health can be supported by digital products.</p>
            
            <h2>Stage 2: Engage Stakeholders in Product Selection</h2>
                <p>The next stage is selecting the most appropriate digital products to support student mental health and well-being. At this stage, you will want to get stakeholder input on all of the factors involved in assessing and selecting digital products.</p>
                <p>Stakeholder engagement during this phase can help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify technological barriers and challenges faced on school campuses and in students’ homes</li>
                    <li>Assess the evidence of products</li>
                    <li>Determine the accessibility needs of students, parents and caregivers regarding the type of technology available in their homes, needs related to disability, and language.</li>
                    <li>Map the ways in which needs assessments connect to outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key Stakeholders involved at this stage<br><p>Students, parents and caregivers, teachers, technology department, school counselors, and other campus mental health professionals.</p></p>
            
            <h2>Stage 3: Engage Stakeholders to Identify & Secure Funding</h2>
                <p>Engaging stakeholder expertise is key to developing a comprehensive funding plan for your district’s digital mental health solutions. This enables you to tap into available resources in your district and community, maximizing program outcomes, and sustaining the product beyond the first year(s) of implementation.</p>
                <p>Stakeholder engagement during the funding phase can help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncover areas of duplicative services, overlapping funding, and ineffective or under-utilized programs in your district that can be discontinued or combined to free up funding.</li>
                    <li>Discover areas where collaboration with other district departments with aligned goals and needs can increase efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Engage district and campus staff responsible for budgeting and grant procurement to help identify and secure financial resources.</li>
                    <li>Invite community and philanthropic partners to support your initiative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key Stakeholders involved at this stage<br> <p>District and campus administrators (including from technology, counseling and social work, and human resources and finance), grant writers and managers, community partners, and philanthropic foundations.</p></p>
            <h2>Stage 4: Engage Stakeholders in Product Implementation</h2>
                <p>Successfully implementing digital products to support student mental health and well-being takes careful planning and involves stakeholders at each stage: pre-implementation, initial roll-out or pilot phase, full implementation, and ongoing quality improvement. Your goal is to develop and fine-tune an effective implementation plan that optimizes program outcomes and the products’ impact on student mental health.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recognize the opportunity to create buy-in with stakeholders</strong><p>The stakeholder engagement process is an opportunity to create buy-in. It allows school personnel tasked with implementing and students and caregivers who will use the product to understand the issues the digital product will address, how it works, and why the digital product will be helpful.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Collect stakeholder feedback to optimize initial implementation</strong><p>Your initial implementation plan should start with pilots to allow for troubleshooting and optimization. Throughout this iterative process, implementation teams provide feedback to the planning team about what is and is not working so they can work together to improve quality. Ensuring implementation is effective before you analyze the impact of the digital mental health product will provide accurate program evaluation data and a better snapshot of its impact.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Continue stakeholder engagement for ongoing quality improvement</strong><p>Quality and consistency are not achieved overnight, so your process may require stepping back, changing the initial plan, managing the expectations of various groups, and continuous communication among all teams. Engage stakeholders annually to ensure the solution continues to meet the changing mental health needs of your students.</p></li>
                    <li><strong>Key Stakeholders involved at this stage</strong><p>Teachers, students, technologists, school counselors and administrators. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Engaging stakeholders throughout the process of identifying opportunities for digital tools to support the mental health needs of students is critical to successful procurement and implementation. Prioritizing time to engage with stakeholders early and often to understand different perspectives, share learnings, and align interests is essential to success. Although the process of engaging stakeholders takes extra time and effort, the investment of both will ensure that your digital mental health and well-being product is implemented effectively for the maximum benefit to students.</p>
