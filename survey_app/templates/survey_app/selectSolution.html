    <section class="title-section" style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;">
        <h2 class="side-title"><em>Select Relevant Products</em>
        </h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p><em>We have crafted an index of products to provide an example of how districts or schools might compile and evaluate possible products according to a set of criteria.</em>
                <strong>You can see our filterable list of products, as well as an explanation of the process used to identify them.</strong></p>
         </div>
        
    </section>


    <div class=" container">
        <h2><strong>Selecting Products That Meet Your Needs</strong></h2>
        <p>With so many products on the market aimed at supporting student well-being, it can be daunting to navigate the landscape of options to find a product that meets your needs. While every district may have different criteria for what they need in a digital well-being product, certain factors such as safety, accessibility, and potential impact are important to consider across contexts.<br> <p>In this section, you’ll find considerations, questions to ask, and resources to support you in evaluating products. This should help you create your own list of criteria and process for product selection.</p></p>

        <h3>Privacy and Safety</h3>
        <p>While digital mental health products provide an opportunity to support student mental health and well-being, they also have the potential to cause harm. It is critical to ensure that products you select have robust policies to ensure student privacy and safety.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Privacy policy<p>You are likely well-versed in the requirements of <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/frequently-asked-questions">FERPA</a> when it comes to student health, but keep in mind that some digital mental health products may also need to adhere to <a href ="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/school-health/hipaa-and-ferpa-basics/">HIPAA</a> protections. You’ll also want to understand the company’s approach to collecting and managing parental and caregiver consent.</p></li>
            <li>Crisis protocols<p>Any product with unrestricted student inputs (such as journaling, chats, mentorship and coaching) can result in students communicating that they may harm themselves or others. If the products you are considering collect this kind of information from students, be sure to ask about their escalation protocols to ensure they align with your own. You’ll also want to be sure that students understand the circumstances in which escalation would happen before using the product, particularly if any elements of the product are billed as anonymous or confidential.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Demonstrated Evidence of Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Nothing is more frustrating than investing significant resources into implementing a solution and not seeing impact on your desired outcomes. While some companies may showcase their evidence in their product highlights, you’ll often need to ask questions to understand whether a product is likely to meet the needs that you have identified.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potential and demonstrated impact<p>What works in one district, school, or classroom may not work in another. You may be interested only in well-established products with rigorous evidence of impact. Or, you may want to consider a newer technology that isn’t yet proven, but was designed with your population in mind and developed using evidence-based practices. Perhaps you want your students to participate in shaping an innovative product through pilot testing. Whatever your focus, it’s important to understand the intended and potential impact of a product. You may want to ask questions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>What outcomes was this product designed to address? Does it have a clear logic model outlining its approach?</li> 
                    <li>What is the product’s demonstrated evidence of impact on health or education outcomes?</li>
                    <li>What type of usage, engagement, and satisfaction results has the company seen from users? How does usage and engagement change over time?</li>
                </ul></p>
            </li>
            <li>Understanding the evidence<p>If the evidence of a product’s impact isn’t externally validated (i.e. through a partnership with a research university), you will want to understand the rigor of any data shared. You may want to ask questions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>How many studies have been conducted?</li>
                    <li>What was the sample size, and what demographics were evaluated?</li>
                    <li>What specific measures were assessed? Are they <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED588476.pdf">reliable and validated</a> scales?</li>
                    <li>What plans do you have for evaluation in the future?</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessibility and Equity </h3>
            <p>It’s imperative that any product you invest in will be accessible to all learners. You will want to ensure that students have the type of technology required to use the product, as well as consider whether the approach and content are understandable, resonant, and relatable for all students, including those with disabilities and for whom English is not their native language.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Type of technology required<p>Be sure that the product utilizes technology that is readily accessible to your student body. You may want to ask questions such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does the product require a web browser or a downloadable app? If an app, is it available on Android as well as iOS?</li>
                        <li>Which hardware is the product optimized for?</li>
                        <li>Do these requirements match up with tech that is readily accessible to your students at school or at home?</li>
                    </ul></p>
                </li>
                <li>Accessibility for students with disabilities<p>You will want to ensure that any product is usable for students with disabilities. You may want to ask questions such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What specific accessibility features does the product offer to ensure it can be used by youth with diverse needs, including those with disabilities?</li>
                        <li>Does the product meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards? WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of technical standards that ensure ADA compliance.</li>
                        <li>If the product does not yet meet WCAG standards, what is the company’s plan for meeting them? In the meantime, how does the company ensure that the product is usable for all students?</li>
                    </ul></p>
                </li>
                <li>Language<p>Most companies will advertise whether their products are offered in languages other than English, but keep in mind that not all translation is the same. You may want to ask questions such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the process for translation to ensure both accuracy and cultural relevance?</li>
                        <li>If the product includes live support, will students have access to support from a native-speaker, or is the company using Google Translate or a similar plug-in to translate conversations?</li>
                    </ul></p>
                </li>
                <li>Other equity considerations<p>User testing can play an important role in determining whether a product is a fit, so it’s ideal to provide students with opportunities to try out products. You’ll also want to know how diverse audiences were considered in the design and ongoing development of a product. You may want to ask questions such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>How were young people involved in initial product design and development? In what ways are they involved in ongoing improvements?</li>
                        <li>Is the language used in student- and family-facing materials inclusive, age-appropriate, and relatable?</li>
                        <li>In what ways does the company ensure that the product is usable for individuals with different levels of digital literacy or technological access?</li>
                        <li>How does the product address the cultural diversity of youth users to ensure it is inclusive and relevant to their backgrounds and experiences</li>
                        <li>Does the product reference and highlight young people with a variety of identities?</li>
                        <li>If there is live support, do providers represent a range of lived experiences to which a diverse student population could relate?</li>
                    </ul></p></li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Implementation and Other Consideration</h3> <p>You should ask as many questions as it takes to ensure that a product aligns with your needs and that the company will provide the implementation support you require. Below, you’ll find several additional categories of questions to support you in determining the right fit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Company experience
                        <ul>
                            <li>What level of experience does the company have implementing their product in schools or districts similar to yours in size and population?</li>
                            <li>How long has the company been in existence?</li>
                            <li>Who are the company’s key competitors in this space, and what differentiates this company from the rest?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Implementation
                        <ul>
                            <li>What will the product cost to implement in the short and long term? Does the company offer to support schools and districts in obtaining funding?</li>
                            <li>What type of implementation support is offered, and for whom (students, families, teachers, staff)?</li>
                            <li>Will the product work with other systems or products that you already have in place?</li>
                            <li>Is there a data management component?</li>
                            <li>Is there an assessment component?</li>
                            <li>Which elements are customizable by the district, school, or teacher?</li>
                            <li>What does ongoing support look like? Keep in mind that companies are most likely to respond quickly during the sales process– if you’re having trouble with communication, consider what ongoing support may look like.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Questions specific to clinical solutions (e.g. teletherapy)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which therapeutic practices are utilized? Are they evidence-based?</li>
                            <li>What experience do clinicians have working with diverse populations? What training is provided to support their work?</li>
                            <li>Does the company bill Medicaid or private insurance for services in addition to fees paid by the school or district?</li>
                            <li>What hours are clinicians available? What happens if a student needs support outside of regular hours?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Tools for product evaluation<p>This list is not exhaustive, so you may want to use an evaluation resource such as the <a href="https://teacher-ready.iste.org/?_ga=2.203471248.1017155953.1712771936-329831899.1709254663">ISTE selection tool</a> to ensure your product assessment isn’t missing anything critical for your school or district. While the ISTE tool was designed specifically for digital learning tools, it may help ensure that your product assessment and selection process is rigorous and comprehensive.</p></li>
