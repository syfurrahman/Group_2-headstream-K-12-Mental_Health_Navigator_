        <p>Methuen Public Schools serves approximately 7,000 students across 9 schools (5 elementary, 3 middle, and 1 high school) in Methuen, Massachusetts. The district faced rising mental health concerns among students, including increased anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. This trend was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted educational continuity and social support networks.</p>
        
        <p>The district's mental health support team, consisting of school counselors, psychologists, and social workers, was stretched thin trying to meet the growing demand for services. Documentation was largely paper-based or spread across multiple digital systems, making it difficult to track student needs, interventions, and outcomes effectively.</p>

        <p>After researching available options, Methuen Public Schools decided to implement a comprehensive digital mental health platform that would streamline screening, documentation, and care coordination. The selected platform included tools for universal mental health screening, progress monitoring, intervention tracking, and resource management.</p>

              <p>The district formed a Mental Health Technology Committee with representatives from counseling, administration, IT, and teaching staff. This committee evaluated different technology options, developed implementation plans, and created privacy protocols.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Clearly define goals:</strong> Establish specific objectives for what you want the technology to accomplish</li>
                  <li><strong>Invest in training:</strong> Allocate sufficient time and resources for staff training and ongoing support</li>
                  <li><strong>Address privacy concerns early:</strong> Develop clear data privacy protocols and communicate them to all stakeholders</li>
                  <li><strong>Create champions:</strong> Identify enthusiastic early adopters who can help drive implementation</li>
                  <li><strong>Measure impact:</strong> Collect both quantitative and qualitative data to assess effectiveness</li>
                  <li><strong>Celebrate successes:</strong> Regularly share wins and positive outcomes to maintain momentum</li>
                  <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Full adoption and integration takes time; expect at least a full academic year for full implementation</li>
